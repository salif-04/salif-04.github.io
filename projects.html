                    <p>Mammography Image Corpus is a Web-App build to oust the existing mechanism of breast cancer reporting which lacks the proper storage and interface for the data. 
                        The target is an interface using which the end users will be able to study these images and generate annotations on them. <br /><br />
                        Mammography Image Corpus serves as an excellent tool for data collection and storage.
